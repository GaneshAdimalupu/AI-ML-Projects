## Understanding

`Logic.py` defines several classes for different types of logical connectives. These classes can be composed within each other, so an expression like `And(Not(A), Or(B, C))` represents the logical sentence stating that symbol `A` is not true, and that symbol `B` or symbol `C` is true (where “or” here refers to inclusive, not exclusive, or).

`logic.py` also contains a function `model_check`. `model_check` takes a knowledge base and a query. The knowledge base is a single logical sentence: if multiple logical sentences are known, they can be joined together in an `And` expression. `model_check` recursively considers all possible models, and returns `True` if the knowledge base entails the query, and returns `False` otherwise.

Now, take a look at `puzzle.py`. At the top, we’ve defined six propositional symbols. `AKnight`, for example, represents the sentence that “A is a knight,” while `AKnave` represents the sentence that “A is a knave.” We’ve similarly defined propositional symbols for characters B and C as well.

What follows are four different knowledge bases, `knowledge0`, `knowledge1`, `knowledge2`, and `knowledge3`, which will contain the knowledge needed to deduce the solutions to the upcoming Puzzles 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Notice that, for now, each of these knowledge bases is empty. That’s where you come in!

The `main` function of this `puzzle.py` loops over all puzzles, and uses model checking to compute, given the knowledge for that puzzle, whether each character is a knight or a knave, printing out any conclusions that the model checking algorithm is able to make.



## Specifications

Add knowledge to knowledge bases `knowledge0`, `knowledge1`, `knowledge2`, and `knowledge3` to solve the following puzzles.

- Puzzle 0 is the puzzle from the Background. It contains a single character, A.
  - A says “I am both a knight and a knave.”
- Puzzle 1 has two characters: A and B.
  - A says “We are both knaves.”
  - B says nothing.
- Puzzle 2 has two characters: A and B.
  - A says “We are the same kind.”
  - B says “We are of different kinds.”
- Puzzle 3 has three characters: A, B, and C.
  - A says either “I am a knight.” or “I am a knave.”, but you don’t know which.
  - B says “A said ‘I am a knave.’”
  - B then says “C is a knave.”
  - C says “A is a knight.”

In each of the above puzzles, each character is either a knight or a knave. Every sentence spoken by a knight is true, and every sentence spoken by a knave is false.
